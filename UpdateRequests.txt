5) Is the P&I calculated based on the loan amount requested by Todd, or is it based on the qualified loan amount?
Maximum qualified loan amount
***P&I must be based on the total loan amount (base + upfront mortgage insurance)
Intrate: 3.625
Monthly: 3.625/12
Term: 360 months
Balance: 650000

Payment is: 2964.33


Intrate: 3.625
Monthly: 3.625/12
Term: 360 months
Balance: 657800
Payment: 2999.91


From the website:
Interest rate: 3.75
Max qualified loan amount: 765000
Estimated Qualifying interest rate: 3.75
Upfront MI 9562.50
Total loan amount: 774562.50

Payment: 3542.83  (This is incorrect because it is based on the qualified loan amount and it should be based on the total loan amount)


6) Cap the maximum qualified loan amount at 417,000.00?
This is the cap for a conforming loan.
Higher than that is a jumbo loan.
